SUMMARY="A collection of tools for Python"
DESCRIPTION="
Pytools is a big bag of things that are “missing” from the Python standard
library. This is mainly a dependency of my other software packages, and is
probably of little interest to you unless you use those. If you’re curious
nonetheless, here’s what’s on offer:

    * A ton of small tool functions such as len_iterable, argmin, tuple
      generation, permutation generation, ASCII table pretty printing, GvR’s
      mokeypatch_xxx() hack, the elusive flatten, and much more.
    * Michele Simionato’s decorator module
    * A time-series logging module, pytools.log.
    * Batch job submission, pytools.batchjob.
    * A lexer, pytools.lex.
